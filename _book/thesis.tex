\section{1.1 Route Directness}\label{route-directness}}

Using Google Maps and Remix, the roundtrip distance, actual length of the route and the shortest path between the start-end stops were determined. In the northbound direction, the 52 Dundas route starts from Orchard at Pleasant and ends at Watson's Lane Loop. In the southbound direction, the 52 Dundas route starts from Watson's Lane Loop and ends at Orchard at Pleasant. The roundtrip distance for the 52 Dundas route from northbound to southbound is 10.49 km. The actual length of the route is 5.2 km in both directions (northbound and southbound). The shortest path between the start-end stops is 5.1 km in both directions (northbound and southbound). Generally known, the ratio indicates the route directness. The ratio between the shortest path and the actual route is 0.98 in both directions meaning the route is quite direct.

\hypertarget{service-coverage}{%
\section{1.2 Service Coverage}\label{service-coverage}}

According to the census data, and route characteristics from OpenStreetMaps, the population size served by the route is approximately 8245 in both directions. The service coverage area within 400 m of the local bus.

52 Dundas route characteristics:
\begin{verbatim}
                             X       Inbound Outbound

2          Actual Route Length        5.2 km   5.2 km
3                Shortest Path        5.1 km   5.1 km
4                        Ratio          0.98

\hypertarget{land-use}{%
\section{1.3 Land Use}\label{land-use}}

The northbound and southbound transit routes for 52 Dundas are both mainly comprised of residential land use considering it provides service to an area that is predominantly surrounded by housing infrastructure. Both directions also have few commercial and institutional land uses. This information was extracted with Remix. Alternatively, it can be extracted with census data for Hamilton.

\hypertarget{service-frequency}{%
\chapter{Service Frequency}\label{service-frequency}}
\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

The purpose of analyzing the service frequency of an existing transit system is to ensure that the level of service has adequate space to accommodate the maximum number of on-board passengers along the entire route over a given time period. Using Remix, both inbound and outbound timetable data were extracted to analyze both the weekday and weekend frequencies and fleet size.

To find the service frequency, divide the total operating hours by the number of trips made by the bus which will give you the average time between each buss arrival along the route or at the stop. Keep in mind, frequency and headway are both terms used to describe the time intervals between buses on a particular route or at a specific bus stop. However, they represent this information in slightly different ways. Frequency refers to the number of bus trips or arrivals at a stop within a specific period, often expressed as the number of buses per hour. For example, a bus service with a frequency of 15 minutes means that a bus arrives approximately every 15 minutes at that stop.

It will be calculated as 1/Time Interval. Headway represents the time interval between the departure or arrival of successive buses. It is the actual time that elapses between one bus leaving or arriving and the next bus following it at a particular stop or along a route.

Headway and frequency can be converted in that:

\[
Frequency = 1/Headway
\]

\[
Headway = 1/Frequency
\]
In other words, Frequency is simply just the inverse of the headway.

\[ Frequency = Headway^{-1} \]

When referring to bus service, a higher frequency or shorter headway generally means better service, providing passengers with more options and shorter waiting times between buses.

\hypertarget{frequency-weekday}{%
\section{3.1 Frequency Weekday}\label{frequency-weekday}}

The frequency weekday was analyzed for both inbound and outbound directions by graphing the average frequency of the existing service for certain time intervals. Based on the frequency data patterns observed for both inbound and outbound, the level of frequency was consistent along the entire route over different time periods for all stops. This was the case for 52 Dundas considering there was not much change in the level of service along the route. To represent the frequency weekday for this route, the frequency of the inbound stop Orchard at Pleasant, and the outbound stop Watson's Lane Loop were used as a benchmark. The maximum frequency for both inbound and outbound is 1.67 buses/hr which occurs during both 06:30 -- 09:30 AM and 15:00 -- 18:00 PM peak hours.

\hypertarget{frequency-weekend}{%
\section{3.2 Frequency Weekend}\label{frequency-weekend}}

Currently, Route 52 Dundas is not scheduled to run during weekends, hence the frequency for the weekend is zero. It could be that there is not enough demand or ridership during the weekends for the 52 Dundas area. This could be something to reconsider when reconfiguring the route.

\hypertarget{fleet-size}{%
\section{3.3 Fleet Size}\label{fleet-size}}

The fleet size for Route 52 is 2 buses for both time periods during the Weekday. As Route 52 does not run-on weekends, there are no fleet sizes reported. The maximum fleet is 2 buses. The buses run every 30 minutes so for the first time period, there is one bus per hour and for the second time period, there is one bus every hour and a half.

Route 52 only runs during the periods of A.M. peak, midday and P.M. peak. Based on this we decided to allocate 34\% to the A.M. peak, 32\% to the midday period and the last 34\% to the P.M. peak. In the data folder, the distribution of boardings at each stop along the route associated with each time period are detailed. From these results, load profile graphs can be generated. This is where the images of the figures should be displayed, however, it was unable to knit.

32 The frequency we found doing the Load Profile Method was found to be the same frequencies as calculated in Service Frequencies. The minimum frequency is 1 bus per hour for all time periods. With this reasoning, we determined that the service currently allocated within each time interval was appropriate. We assumed the desired occupancy of a 40 ft bus which requires 35 passengers and a capacity of 75 passengers.

28 The frequency we found doing the Load Profile Method was found to be the same frequencies as calculated in Service Frequencies. The minimum frequency is 1 bus per hour for all time periods. With this reasoning, we determined that the service currently allocated within each time interval was appropriate. We assumed the desired occupancy of a 40 ft bus which requires 35 passengers and a capacity of 75 passengers.

\subsection{Service Evaluation}\label{service-evaluation}}

Use the data file labelled ``Load Profile Analysis'' to begin analyzing the how frequency changes throughout the time periods in a day. In order to evaluate the service utilization, the current frequency and the optimal frequency in each direction must be compared. Based on the steps, the results should be as follows.

For the AM/PM peaks, the current frequency is higher than optimal and therefore the allocated service is over-utilized. Ideally the frequency should be decreased to the minimum of 1 bus per hour to save costs and avoid running empty buses. For the mid-day time period the frequency was 0 as no buses were running at the time however by analyzing the data from task 4 and 5 we can see that the frequency can be brought up to the minimum of 1 bus per hour to accommodate the demand for mid-day service.

From the excel file, Load\_Profile\_Analysis, the desired occupancy of the buses operating on 52 Dundas have a desired occupancy of 35 and a capacity of 75 passengers. The total length route will be the summation of all the distances divided by 1000 to get the distance in kilometres.

\[
Total Distance = \sum (Distance To  Stop)/1000
\]

When analyzing the load profiles, setting up the table as such will make it easier to calculate the Frequencies.

For the northbound direction, the frequency we found doing the Load Profile Method was found to be the same frequencies as calculated in Service Frequencies. The minimum frequency is 1 bus per hour for all time periods. With this reasoning, we determined that the service currently allocated within each time interval was appropriate. We assumed the desired occupancy of a 40 ft bus which requires 35 passengers and a capacity of 75 passengers.

A simple analysis was completed for 52 Dundas route in an effort to observe the existing system's infrastructure through changes in operational quality, service quality, and overall connectedness of the transportation grid. From these results, different reconfigurations could be made based on minimizing costs or improving the service within communities in close proximity to the 52 Dundas HSR route. However, it is important to note that there is no perfect, silver-bullet solution for this route or any route for that matter.

The data provided as well as the process of extracting these results have been outlined within this project. File naming, version control with Github, determining the appropriate tools (R Studio and Excel) to use, identifying the infrastructure and then creating a process flow were completed. This project can hopefully be reproduced and repeated with the data and the instructions provided.Ideally, the steps outlined in each of the chapters should allow a user to repeat the steps with the same data provided or alternatively, reproduce similar results with other APC data.

On a personal note, it has been a huge learning experience for me. I have been able to learn many new skills that I did not have at the start of this semester. I came into this course with null knowledge of R and Github and it is amazing what I can now do with the skills I have! Thank you so much Antonio!
