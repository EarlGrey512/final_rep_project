,"The frequency we found doing the Load Profile Method was found to be the same frequencies as calculated in Service Frequencies. The minimum frequency is 1 bus per hour for all time periods. With this reasoning, we determined that the service currently allocated within each time interval was appropriate. We assumed the desired occupancy of a 40 ft bus which requires 35 passengers and a capacity of 75 passengers.",,,,,,,,,,,,
