# Chapter 1: Route Alignment 
___

## 1.1 Route Directness
Using Google Maps and Remix, the roundtrip distance, actual length of the route and the shortest path between the start-end stops were determined. In the northbound direction, the 52 Dundas route starts from Orchard at Pleasant and ends at Watsonâ€™s Lane Loop. In the southbound direction, the 52 Dundas route starts from Watson's Lane Loop and ends at Orchard at Pleasant. The roundtrip distance for the 52 Dundas route from northbound to southbound is 10.49 km. The actual length of the route is 5.2 km in both directions (northbound and southbound). The shortest path between the start-end stops is 5.1 km in both directions (northbound and southbound). Generally known, the ratio indicates the route directness. The ratio between the shortest path and the actual route is 0.98 in both directions meaning the route is quite direct.

## 1.2 Service Coverage

According to the census data, and route characteristics from OpenStreetMaps, the population size served by the route is approximately 8245 in both directions. The service coverage area within 400 m of the local bus. Below is a table outline the following characteristics.

# Conclusion {-}

If we don't want Conclusion to have a chapter number next to it, we can add the `{-}` attribute.

**More info**

And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter title or section head _shouldn't be_ indented, because indents are to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add an indent there.
