# Chapter 1: Route Alignment 
___

## 1.1 Route Directness
Using Google Maps and Remix, the roundtrip distance, actual length of the route and the shortest path between the start-end stops were determined. In the northbound direction, the 52 Dundas route starts from Orchard at Pleasant and ends at Watsonâ€™s Lane Loop. In the southbound direction, the 52 Dundas route starts from Watson's Lane Loop and ends at Orchard at Pleasant. The roundtrip distance for the 52 Dundas route from northbound to southbound is 10.49 km. The actual length of the route is 5.2 km in both directions (northbound and southbound). The shortest path between the start-end stops is 5.1 km in both directions (northbound and southbound). Generally known, the ratio indicates the route directness. The ratio between the shortest path and the actual route is 0.98 in both directions meaning the route is quite direct.

## 1.2 Service Coverage

According to the census data, and route characteristics from OpenStreetMaps, the population size served by the route is approximately 8245 in both directions. The service coverage area within 400 m of the local bus. Below is a table outline the following characteristics.

## Math

\TeX\ is the best way to typeset mathematics. Donald Knuth designed \TeX\ when he got frustrated at how long it was taking the typesetters to finish his book, which contained a lot of mathematics.  One nice feature of _R Markdown_ is its ability to read LaTeX code directly.

If you are doing a thesis that will involve lots of math, you will want to read the following section which has been commented out. If you're not going to use math, skip over or delete this next commented section.


<!-- MATH and PHYSICS majors: Uncomment the following section -->
$$
\sum_{j=1}^n (\delta\theta_j)^2 \leq {{\beta_i^2}\over{\delta_i^2 + \rho_i^2}}
\left[ 2\rho_i^2 + {\delta_i^2\beta_i^2\over{\delta_i^2 + \rho_i^2}} \right] \equiv \omega_i^2
$$

From Informational Dynamics, we have the following (Dave Braden):
<!--

After _n_ such encounters the posterior density for $\theta$ is

$$
\pi(\theta|X_1< y_1,\dots,X_n<y_n) \varpropto \pi(\theta) \prod_{i=1}^n\int_{-\infty}^{y_i}
   \exp\left(-{(x-\theta)^2\over{2\sigma^2}}\right)\ dx
$$

Another equation:

$$
\det\left|\,\begin{matrix}%
c_0&c_1\hfill&c_2\hfill&\ldots&c_n\hfill\cr
c_1&c_2\hfill&c_3\hfill&\ldots&c_{n+1}\hfill\cr
c_2&c_3\hfill&c_4\hfill&\ldots&c_{n+2}\hfill\cr
\,\vdots\hfill&\,\vdots\hfill&
  \,\vdots\hfill&&\,\vdots\hfill\cr
c_n&c_{n+1}\hfill&c_{n+2}\hfill&\ldots&c_{2n}\hfill\cr
\end{matrix}\right|>0

Another L\&P (p145)

$$
\int_{-1}^1\!\int_{-1}^1\!\int_{-1}^1 f\big(\xi,\eta,\zeta\big)
   = \sum_{k=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n\sum_{i=1}^n w_i w_j w_k f\big( \xi,\eta,\zeta\big).
$$

Another L\&P (p126)

$$
\int_{A_e} (\,\cdot\,) dx dy = \int_{-1}^1\!\int_{-1}^1 (\,\cdot\,) \det[J] d\xi d\eta.

## Physics

Many of the symbols you will need can be found on the math page <https://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/math.html> and the Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol Guide (<https://mirror.utexas.edu/ctan/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-letter.pdf>).

## Biology

You will probably find the resources at <https://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/latex.html> helpful, particularly the links to bsts for various journals. You may also be interested in TeXShade for nucleotide typesetting (<https://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/beitz/txe.html>).  Be sure to read the proceeding chapter on graphics and tables.

# Conclusion {-}

If we don't want Conclusion to have a chapter number next to it, we can add the `{-}` attribute.

**More info**

And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter title or section head _shouldn't be_ indented, because indents are to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add an indent there.

If you'd like to change the name of the bibliography to something else,
delete "References" and replace it.

# References {-}
<!--
This manually sets the header for this unnumbered chapter.
-->
\markboth{References}{References}
<!--
To remove the indentation of the first entry.
-->
\noindent

<!--
To create a hanging indent and spacing between entries.  These three lines may need to be removed for styles that don't require the hanging indent.

\setlength{\parindent}{-0.20in}

\setlength{\parskip}{8pt}


<!--
This is just for testing with more citations for the bibliography at the end.  Add other entries into the list here if you'd like them to appear in the bibliography even if they weren't explicitly cited in the document.
